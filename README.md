## Site Creation Event Handler - Version 1.8

One of the features that has been most requested by our customers has been the possibility of creating sub-sites that are automatically linked to a list so that when you create an item in the list a specific web site is created which uses a specified template and includes the possibility of selecting certain permissions for the new site.

In this way you can quickly create sites in a semi-automatic manner, which allows for easier management of your site structure.
