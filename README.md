# SPSProfessional Site Creation

SPSProfessional Site Creation / Provisioning is a solution that will allow you to create sites in a semi-automatic mode with sub-sites automatically linked to a list, so that when you create an item in a list a certain Web site is created, with a specific template and the possibility of being able to select certain permissions for the new site.

The solution is being implemented as a feature that can be displayed on any Web. This feature will allow you to add the event any web site where it has been activated. Once this feature is activated you will find a new option in the site configuration (Site Settings) under the Management site heading (Site Administration)


Through this option you can manage the lists to which you want to link this event. The main screen will show you a toolbar which links the event to. The main screen will show us a toolbar to link the event to a new list and below this the list of names that currently have the creation events sites activated. By clicking on "Attach new list" you will access a screen where you can select the list to which you want to link the event.

The list requires at least:

- A text field where the list user will specify the name of the new site  
- A hyperlink field where we will store the new created site Url  
- A choice field to allow us to choose the templates.

Each of the necessary fields has been identified. When there is more than one text field where you can enter the name of the new site, you can select the one you would prefer to use.

You can determine the permissions of the new site by the following interface. You can establish whether the new site will inherit the permissions from the current site (default option) you want to establish new permissions (selecting the unique permissions box)

Finally you can establish whether the created site is deleted when the item is deleted from the list.
